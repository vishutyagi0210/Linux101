# Stage 05 – Doing multiple things

## Control

In this stage, you will learn to be a conductor.
You won't just run one command and wait. You will chain them together.

### In this stage, you will:
- Run a sequence of commands (`cmd1 ; cmd2`)
- Chain commands conditionally (`cmd1 && cmd2`)
- Handle failures gracefully (`cmd1 || cmd2`)

👉 **Mindset outcome**: "I control the flow."
