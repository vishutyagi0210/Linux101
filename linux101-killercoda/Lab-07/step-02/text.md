## 1. The Concept
If you use `>`, you destroy the old content.
To **add** to a file without deleting the old stuff, use the double Greater Than symbol `>>`.

## 2. The Task
Add "I am learning" to the end of `welcome.txt`.

Run this command:

```bash
echo "I am learning" >> welcome.txt
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
The file now contains two lines.
Run `cat welcome.txt` to see for yourself!
