# Stage 06 – Working with output

## Power

In this stage, you will learn to harness the flow of data.
Linux commands generate text. You can capture that text, save it, or feed it into another command.

### In this stage, you will:
- Save command results to a file (`>`)
- Add to a file without overwriting (`>>`)
- Feed a file into a command (`<`)
- Connect two commands directly (`|`)
- Match many files with one symbol (`*`)

👉 **Mindset outcome**: "I control the data flow."
