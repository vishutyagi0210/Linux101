## 1. The Concept
The terminal is just a conversation partner. It doesn't guess; it waits for you to tell it what to do.
Think of it like a very literal genie. You ask, it does.

## 2. The Task
Let's say hello. The `echo` command simply repeats what you say.

Run this command:

```bash
echo "hello linux"
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You should see `hello linux` printed back to you. Use this to verify that the terminal is listening and ready.

**Mindset**: "I can make the system respond to me."
