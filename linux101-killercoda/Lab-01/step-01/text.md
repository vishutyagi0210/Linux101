## Scenario

The terminal is how humans **talk to Linux**.

It does exactly what you tell it to do.
No magic. No traps.

### Your task

Run this command:

```bash
echo "hello linux"
```
- if you hit any validation error even though you have write the correct command.

```bash
# try 
history -a
``` 
then try again !!
