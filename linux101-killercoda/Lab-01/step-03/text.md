# Lab 3: What System Is This?

## 1. The Concept
Linux comes in many flavors called "distributions" (like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian). Just like knowing whether you're driving a truck or a sports car, it helps to know what you're running.

## 2. The Task
Let's read the system's identification card using the `cat` command (which reads files).

Run this command:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You will see detailed information about the operating system, including its name (e.g., "Ubuntu") and version number.

**Mindset**: "I know exactly what environment I am in."
