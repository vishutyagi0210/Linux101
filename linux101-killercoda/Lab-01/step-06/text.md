# Lab 6: Is It The Future Yet?

## 1. The Concept
Time matters in Linux. Logs, security certificates, and scheduled tasks all depend on accurate time. If your clock is wrong, things break.

## 2. The Task
Ask the system for the current date and time.

Run this command:

```bash
date
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
Linux responded with the exact date, time, and timezone (e.g., `UTC` or `EST`).

**Mindset**: "Time is critical for order."
