# Lab 4: The Heart of the System

## 1. The Concept
At the very core of Linux is the **Kernel**. It's the engine that talks to the hardware. You mostly interact with the shell (the steering wheel), but the kernel does the heavy lifting.

## 2. The Task
Check the version of the engine under the hood.

Run this command:

```bash
uname -r
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You saw a series of numbers (e.g., `5.15.0...`). This is your kernel version. It tells you how modern your system's engine is.

**Mindset**: "There is an engine running this machine."
