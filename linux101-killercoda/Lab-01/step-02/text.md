# Lab 2: Who Are You?

## 1. The Concept
In Linux, every action is performed by a **user**. The system needs to know who you are to decide what you are allowed to do.

## 2. The Task
Ask the system who it thinks you are.

Run this command:

```bash
whoami
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
The system replied with your username (likely `root` or `ubuntu`). This confirms your identity in the current session.

---
**Mindset**: "I have an identity on this system."
