## 1. The Concept
Every computer on a network has a name. This is its **Hostname**.
It's how other computers refer to it, instead of using a confusing IP address.

## 2. The Task
Find out what your machine calls itself.

Run this command:

```bash
hostname
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You saw a name (e.g., `controlplane` or `node01`). This is your machine's ID card on the network.

**Mindset**: "I have a name in the network."
