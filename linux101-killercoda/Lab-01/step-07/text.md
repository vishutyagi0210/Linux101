# Lab 7: What Is My Name?

## 1. The Concept
Just like people, computers have names. This is how other computers on the network find them. We call this the **hostname**.

## 2. The Task
Discover the specialized name of this machine.

Run this command:

```bash
hostname
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You saw the machine's name (e.g., `controlplane` or `node01`). This is how the network sees this computer.

**Mindset**: "I am distinct from others."
