# Lab 5: How long have I been here?

## 1. The Concept
Some Linux servers run for years without restarting. Knowing how long a system has been running is a badge of honor (and vital for troubleshooting).

## 2. The Task
Check the system's "uptime".

Run this command:

```bash
uptime
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You will see how long the system has been up (e.g., `up 2 min`) and how busy it is (load average).

**Mindset**: "Stability is measurable."
