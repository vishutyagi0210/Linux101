# Stage 01 – Orientation

Welcome.

If this is your **first time touching Linux**, relax.
Nothing you do here will break anything.

Linux listens.
Linux responds.
Linux does not judge.

In this stage, you will:
- Open the terminal
- Learn who you are on the system
- Discover your Ubuntu version
- Understand uptime, time, and hostname

👉 Goal: **Remove fear. Build confidence.**
