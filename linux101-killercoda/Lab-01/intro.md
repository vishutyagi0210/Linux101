# Lab 01 – Orientation
## Your First Steps in Linux (Zero Fear)

Welcome to Linux.

If this is your **first time ever** touching Linux — relax.
Nothing in this stage can break your system.

In this stage, you will:
- Open and understand the terminal
- Learn who *you* are inside Linux
- Discover your Ubuntu version
- Understand what the Linux kernel is
- Check system uptime
- Read system time and date
- Discover your system hostname

🎯 **Mindset outcome**
> “I’m not scared anymore.”

Take it slow. Read the output. Linux always explains itself.
