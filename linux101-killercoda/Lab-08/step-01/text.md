## 1. The Concept
To create a file without opening an editor, use the `touch` command.
It creates an **empty** file.
(If the file already exists, it updates the timestamp, but doesn't change content).

## 2. The Task
Create a file named `ghost.txt`.

Run this command:

```bash
touch ghost.txt
```

## 3. What just happened?
You created a file out of thin air. It has 0 bytes, but it exists.
Check it with `ls -l` if you like.
