# Stage 07 – Creating things

## Ownership

In this stage, you will learn to be a creator.
Up until now, you have mostly looked at things or redirected things. Now you will bring new files into existence.

### In this stage, you will:
- Create empty files from nothing (`touch`)
- Create files with content instantly
- Append data safely
- Understand that "creation time" is also "modification time"

👉 **Mindset outcome**: "I own the filesystem."
