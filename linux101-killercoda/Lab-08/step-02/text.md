## 1. The Concept
Files need a place to live. That place is a **Directory** (folder).
To create a new directory, use `mkdir` (Make Directory).

## 2. The Task
Create a directory named `workspace`.

Run this command:

```bash
mkdir workspace
```

## 3. What just happened?
You created a new container for your files.
Verify it with `ls -d workspace` or just `ls`.
