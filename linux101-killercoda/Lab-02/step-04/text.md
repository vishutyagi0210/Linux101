# Lab 11: There's No Place Like Home

## 1. The Concept
Every user has a private space called the **Home Directory**.
Linux provides a shortcut to get there quickly: the tilde symbol `~`.

## 2. The Task
Return to your safe haven immediately.

Run this command:

```bash
cd ~
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You were instantly transported back to your personal directory, no matter where you were before.
