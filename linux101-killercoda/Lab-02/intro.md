## Stage 1 – Where am I?

Before using Linux, you must understand one basic thing:

👉 Linux always works relative to a **location**.

Every command you run happens inside a directory.
If you don’t know where you are, commands will feel confusing.

In this stage, you will learn:
- how to check your current location
- how to see what exists there
- how to move safely between directories
- how Linux organizes user and system areas

No command here changes the system.
Everything is safe to run.
