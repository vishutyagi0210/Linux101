# Stage 01 – Orientation

## Where Am I?

Before using Linux, you must understand one basic thing:

👉 Linux always works relative to a **location**.

Every command you run happens *inside* a directory.
If you don’t know where you are, commands will feel confusing.

### In this stage, you will:
- Check your current location
- See what exists around you
- Move safely between directories
- Explore how Linux organizes user and system areas

👉 **Goal**: "Linux has structure, not chaos."
