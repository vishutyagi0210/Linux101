## 1. The Concept
Sometimes you jump to a directory and realize you need to go back where you just were.
You don't need to remember the path. Linux remembers for you.

## 2. The Task
Switch back to the **previous** directory you were in.

Run this command:

```bash
cd -
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You jumped back to the Root directory (since that was where you were before Home).
