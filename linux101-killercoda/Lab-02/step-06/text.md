# Lab 13: The Root of All Things

## 1. The Concept
The **Root Directory** `/` is the start of everything. All other files and directories branch off from here.
It’s like the trunk of the tree.

## 2. The Task
Take a look at the foundation of the OS.

Run this command:

```bash
ls /
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You saw list of standard directories like `bin`, `etc`, `home`, `var`, `usr`. This is the standard layout of almost every Linux system.
