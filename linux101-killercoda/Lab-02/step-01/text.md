## 1. The Concept
Imagine you are dropped into a maze. The first thing you need to know is your current location.
In Linux, you are always "inside" a directory. Commands affect files *here* unless you say otherwise.

## 2. The Task
Ask Linux for your **P**resent **W**orking **D**irectory.

Run this command:

```bash
pwd
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
Linux printed the full path to where you are standing (e.g., `/root` or `/home/ubuntu`).

**Mindset**: "I always know my location."
