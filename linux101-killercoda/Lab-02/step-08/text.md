## What you are learning

Linux stores system configuration in a dedicated place.
That place is the `/etc` directory.

You normally **do not create files here** as a beginner.
You only need to know what it contains.

## Command

```bash
ls /etc
Explanation
/etc contains system configuration files

These files control how the system behaves

Most files here are text-based configuration files

For now, you are only observing.

Your Task
List the contents of the /etc directory:

ls /etc
