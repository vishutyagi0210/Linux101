# Lab 14: The Neighborhood

## 1. The Concept
Linux is designed for many users. Each user gets a directory under `/home` to store their personal files (documents, downloads, etc.).
It’s like an apartment building where everyone has their own unit.

## 2. The Task
See who "lives" on this system.

Run this command:

```bash
ls /home
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You likely saw a directory for your user (e.g., `ubuntu`) and maybe others.
