# Lab 9: What Is Around Me?

## 1. The Concept
Once you know *where* you are, you need to see *what* is around you.
Linux doesn't show you files automatically; you have to ask for a list.

## 2. The Task
**L**i**s**t the files and directories in your current location.

Run this command:

```bash
ls
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You saw the names of files and folders in your current directory. If nothing printed, the directory is empty.
