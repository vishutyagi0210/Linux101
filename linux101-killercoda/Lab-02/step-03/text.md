# Lab 10: Going to the Top

## 1. The Concept
The filesystem is a tree. The very bottom (or top, depending on how you look at it) is called the **Root**.
It is represented by a single forward slash: `/`.

## 2. The Task
**C**hange **D**irectory to the root of the filesystem.

Run this command:

```bash
cd /
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error even though you wrote the correct command:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
Your prompt likely changed. You are now at the base of the entire Linux system.
