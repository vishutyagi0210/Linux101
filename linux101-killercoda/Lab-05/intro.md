# Stage 04 – Memory & Speed

## Efficiency

In this stage, you will learn how to be lazy in the best way possible.
A good Linux user never types the same command twice.

### In this stage, you will:
- View your entire command history
- Re-run the last command instantly
- Execute specific commands from the past
- Search your history for that one long command you forgot

👉 **Mindset outcome**: "I don’t need to memorize everything."
