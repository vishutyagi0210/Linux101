## 1. The Concept
You don't need to remember everything you typed. Linux remembers for you.
The `history` command shows you a list of everything you've done in this session.

## 2. The Task
See your past actions.

Run this command:

```bash
history
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You saw a numbered list of commands. Those numbers are important.

**Mindset**: "I have a trail."
