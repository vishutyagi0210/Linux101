## 1. The Concept
Scrolling through `history` is slow. Searching is fast.
**Ctrl+R** opens a "Recursive Search". You start typing, and it finds the most recent matching command.

## 2. The Task
Let's find the "history mark" command again without scrolling.
1. Press **Ctrl+R**.
2. Type `mark`.
3. You should see `echo "history mark"`.
4. Press **Enter** to run it.

(Note: If Ctrl+R doesn't work in this specific browser implementation, just typing `!mark` also works as a search shortcut!)

## 3. What just happened?
You found a needle in a haystack instantly.

**Mindset**: "Search is faster than scrolling."
