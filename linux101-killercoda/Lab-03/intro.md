# Stage 02 – Seeing Clearly

## Reading the Terminal

In this stage, you will learn to read what the terminal is telling you.
Linux isn't hiding anything; you just need to know how to look.

### In this stage, you will:
- Understand command output columns
- Find hidden files
- Read file permissions and ownership
- View file sizes in a human-readable format
- Explore directory structures efficiently

👉 **Goal**: "I can read what Linux shows me."
