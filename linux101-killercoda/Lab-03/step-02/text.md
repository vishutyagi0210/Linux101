# Lab 19: Hidden In Plain Sight

## 1. The Concept
Linux hides files that start with a dot (`.`). These are usually configuration files that you don't need to see every day.
But they are there.

## 2. The Task
Reve**a**l **a**ll files, including hidden ones.

Run this command:

```bash
ls -a
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You saw files like `.bashrc` or `.profile` that were invisible before.

**Mindset**: "Nothing is truly hidden."
