## 1. The Concept
`ls -R` is powerful, but the output can be messy.
Sometimes you want to see the hierarchy as a **Tree**.
There is a command literally called `tree`.

## 2. The Task
Visualize the `project` directory as a tree.

Run this command:

```bash
tree project
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You saw a beautiful diagram of folders and files connecting to each other.
(If the command failed initially, it might have been installing. Try running it again!)

**Mindset**: "I can visualize the system."
