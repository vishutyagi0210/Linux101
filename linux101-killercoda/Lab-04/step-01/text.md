## 1. The Concept
Use standard commands; don't make up words.
A command is asking the system to *do* something.

## 2. The Task
Run the `date` command. It takes no extra information. It just does its one job.

Run this command:

```bash
date
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
Linux responded with the current date and time. Simplicity.

**Mindset**: "Commands are actions."
