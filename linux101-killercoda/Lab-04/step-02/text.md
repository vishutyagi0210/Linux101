## 1. The Concept
You can change *how* a command behaves using **Options**.
Options usually start with a dash `-`.

## 2. The Task
Run `date` again, but ask for Universal Time (UTC) using the `-u` option.

Run this command:

```bash
date -u
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
The time displayed is now in UTC. Same command, different behavior.

**Mindset**: "I can modify the action."
