# Stage 03 – Talking to Linux

## Command Basics

In this stage, you will learn the grammar of Linux.
Just like a sentence has a verb, object, and adjective, a Linux command has structure.

### In this stage, you will:
- Learn the syntax: `Command [Options] [Arguments]`
- Use Tab completion to type faster and safer
- Understand what errors actually mean
- Check if a command succeeded or failed internally

👉 **Mindset outcome**: "Linux responds logically."
