## 1. The Concept
Some commands are dangerous (`rm`), some are safe (`echo`).
Before you run anything, you need to know what it does. `echo` just repeats what you say. It is always safe.

## 2. The Task
Run a safe command to practice your confidence.

Run this command:

```bash
echo "safety first"
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
The terminal simply printed your words. Nothing broke.

**Mindset**: "I know what I am running."
