## 1. The Concept
Typing long filenames is slow and error-prone.
Linux has a superpower called **Tab Completion**. You type the start of a name, press `Tab`, and Linux finishes it for you.

## 2. The Task
Type `cat /etc/os-` and then press the **Tab** key. It should auto-complete to `cat /etc/os-release`.
Then press Enter.

Run this command (using Tab):

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you hit any validation error:
> ```bash
> # try 
> history -a
> ``` 
> then try again!

## 3. What just happened?
You saved keystrokes and avoided typos.
