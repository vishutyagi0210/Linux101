# Nginx Stage 02 – Web Server + Traffic Analysis

## From Hosting to Investigating

You've mastered the basics. Now it's time to configure Nginx like a professional web server administrator AND investigate real production incidents.

### What You'll Build:
- **Multi-site hosting** with virtual hosts
- **Professional error pages** for better UX
- **Security hardening** with headers and access control
- **Protected areas** with authentication

### What You'll Investigate:
A **real traffic spike scenario** where you'll determine if it's:
- ✅ Legitimate user growth
- 🚨 Bot/scraper attack
- ⚠️ DDoS attempt

You'll use the same techniques production engineers use daily.

### In this stage, you will:
- Configure virtual hosts for multiple websites
- Create custom error pages
- Enable directory listing
- Add security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Control access by IP address
- Implement password protection
- **Investigate a traffic spike using production-grade log analysis**

### Real-World Skills:
- `awk` for log parsing
- `grep` for pattern matching
- `sort | uniq -c` for counting
- Timestamp analysis
- Bot detection
- Attack pattern recognition

👉 **Mindset outcome**: "I can host production websites AND investigate security incidents."
