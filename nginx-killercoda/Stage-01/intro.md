# Nginx Stage 01 – Foundation + First Troubleshooting

## From Zero to Debugging

Welcome to your Nginx journey! This stage takes you from installation to your first real troubleshooting scenario. You'll not only learn how Nginx works, but also how to debug it when things go wrong.

### What is Nginx?

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer. It powers some of the world's largest websites including Netflix, Airbnb, and WordPress.com.

### Why Nginx?
- **Speed**: Event-driven architecture handles thousands of connections efficiently
- **Reliability**: Battle-tested in production environments
- **Flexibility**: Web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and more
- **Low Resource Usage**: Minimal memory footprint

### In this stage, you will:
- ✅ Install and manage Nginx service
- ✅ Understand master/worker process architecture
- ✅ Navigate configuration file structure
- ✅ Serve static websites
- ✅ Test configurations safely (and fix broken ones!)
- ✅ Read and analyze access/error logs
- ✅ **Troubleshoot your first production issue** (404 vs 502 vs 503)

### What makes this different?
This isn't just theory. You'll encounter **real problems** and learn to **debug like a sysadmin**.

👉 **Mindset outcome**: "I understand Nginx AND can troubleshoot common issues."
